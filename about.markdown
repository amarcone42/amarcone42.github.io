I'm a computer science student of University of Salerno, based in Naples.

I'm learning and making websites, as a **front end developer**, and videogames, as a **game developer**. I also write for passion and I'm trying to write more fictions.

I love movies, art and travel. I'm interested in photography and philosophy.

## Skills and tools
I'm a creative person with high attention to details, curious to learn and try new experiences. I've some experiences with programming languages like _C, C#, Java, GScript_ and tools like _Visual Studio, Eclipse, Unity, Godot_.

I've also web development experience with _HTML5, CSS and SASS, JavaScript, React and Next.js_.
