Social network for activism groups developed as a Human-machine Interaction exam project.

## Software documentation and code

All the code of the software prototype is publicly available on the [Agorà GitHub page](https://github.com/amarcone42/agora). No software documentation has been made, only design documentation, available in the same repository in the [documentation](https://github.com/amarcone42/agora/tree/master/documentation) section.

## Purpose of the software

The aim of the software is to provide communities of social activism with a platform where they can connect remotely, publishing news, events and communicating with each other.
The project was developed starting from the theme of "Engagin Community and Inclusion".

## Aim of the exam project

The focus of the exam project was to analyze the chosen reference community and design a system taking into account the needs of the users, to provide an optimal user experience.

## Role in the group

My role in the group was both group manager and design manager. This allowed me to experience not only group management but also overseeing all design decisions.

## Project phases

### 1. Research

The starting point was to create a questionnaire, provided to real users of the chosen community, and to develop user personas that represented the responses obtained.

I have chosen, together with my colleagues, personal objectives for each persona. Then the tasks that could be performed with the system were established. 

### 2. Use cases and analysis

Starting from the tasks, the use cases of the software system were developed. This allowed us to clarify the interactions of the users with the system.

Once the use cases were completed, we developed a comparative analysis with the main competitor software. The analysis allowed us to understand what the users' references were and which interfaces were familiar.

### 3. Project idea and sketches

In this phase I independently developed my own idea of ​​software, represented through interface sketches. I depicted the main screens and described the user experience.

### 4. Wireframe, design patterns and analysis

At this stage we brought the ideas together by choosing the design patterns to be used in the system. We then represented the software through more detailed wireframes that could depict the final user interface.
We finished this phase by analyzing the user experience in relation to the use cases and making the changes necessary to improve usability.

### 5. Figma prototype and usability evaluation

We built a prototype of the software in Figma to be able to comfortably design the final user interface, testing the interactions.
At this stage I managed to greatly improve my skills in using Figma, previously used only for small private ideas.

After finishing the prototype, we were able to test the intended use cases. This allowed us to perform a usability evaluation, establishing what worked and what didn't.

Once the evaluation was completed, we chose the necessary changes to make to refine the experience and the user interface.

### 6. Implementation

In the last phase I was able to dedicate myself to the development of the designed software. New development technologies were chosen compared to the other exams taken, such as Next.js. This allowed me to study an important framework for web applications, obtaining practical experience in its use.
