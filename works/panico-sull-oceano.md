A murder mystery dinner hosted by a mysterious wealthy man aboard a luxury yacht headed out to sea. What could possibly go wrong? Innocent detective Stephen Hall knows the answer when he accidentally gets caught up in a manhunt on the ocean. Her only chance to survive the massacre is to find and stop the killer before becoming his victim. The risk is to panic.

## Development

The novel's conception and writing began in my penultimate year of high school. For the first time I found myself writing a complete novel from start to finish, first planning the setting and characters and then developing the events in an attempt to build an intriguing puzzle for the reader.

At the end of the draft I asked a friend for help with any corrections and I gathered some opinions by having my teacher and friends read the novel.

In the end I decided to self-publish the text with Amazon since I had just turned 18, without knowing much about the publishing world.

## Award

After publication, I tried to enter the novel into the Golden Books Awards 2019 competition, managing to get a mention from the jury.

## Where to get it

The novel is available in Italian on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.it/Panico-sulloceano-Antonio-Marcone/dp/1729170145/ref=sr_1_4) in paperback or digital format.
